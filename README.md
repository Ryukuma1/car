# Random Event Simulation Tool

## Description

The Random Event Simulation Tool is a Python-based application that allows users to simulate random events and analyze the outcomes. This tool is designed to help users understand probability, statistics, and random processes by providing a practical way to explore various scenarios.

## Implementation

The project is implemented using the following methods and libraries:

- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the application.
- **Streamlit**: A Python library for creating interactive web applications. Streamlit is used for building the user interface of the simulation tool.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library in Python, used for handling and analyzing data.
- **Plotly Express**: A Python library for creating interactive data visualizations, such as plots and charts.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental library for numerical computations in Python, often used for generating random numbers and performing mathematical operations.

## Getting Started

To launch the Random Event Simulation Tool on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/random-event-simulation.git

    Navigate to the Project Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's directory.

    bash

cd random-event-simulation

Create a Virtual Environment (Optional): It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

bash

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:

    bash

venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS and Linux:

bash

    source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages using pip.

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Application: Start the Streamlit application.

bash

    streamlit run app.py

    Access the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to access the Random Event Simulation Tool.

    Interact and Simulate: Use the tool's user interface to customize and simulate random events. Analyze the outcomes and explore different scenarios.
